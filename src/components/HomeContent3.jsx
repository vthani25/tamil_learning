                    <div className="card-content">Tamil is widely regarded as the oldest living language in the world, with continuous usage for over 2,000 years. Unlike Latin or Sanskrit, which became less commonly spoken, Tamil has remained vibrant and evolving. It was officially declared a Classical Language of India in 2004, recognizing its rich literary and historical significance.</div>

Rahman, who began in Tamil cinema, is now a global name, but still regularly scores Tamil films. Their music isn't just popular—it's emotionally rooted in Tamil identity, often defining the sound of entire generations.</div>

The engineering is so precise that the shadow of the main tower never falls on the ground at noon.</div>

                    <div className="card-content">Some of the oldest inscriptions in Tamil, written in the Tamil-Brahmi script, were found on cave walls in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, dating back to at least 500 BCE. These inscriptions offer glimpses into early Tamil society, trade, and spirituality, showing how advanced and literate Tamil civilization was at a time when much of the world was still tribal.</div>

It is known for its fixed upper torso, bent legs, intricate footwork, and expressive hand gestures (mudras).

                    <div className="card-content">Avvaiyar, a revered Tamil poet, lived over 1,000 years ago and wrote poems for children that are still memorized in schools today. Her verses like “Aathichudi” and “Kondrai Vendhan” use simple language to teach moral values, self-discipline, and kindness. She was also known for her wit—there’s even a legend where she outsmarts a young Lord Murugan with her wisdom!</div>

Made of unhewn stones and without any cement, it’s still functioning today—over 1,800 years later. It was designed to divert water for irrigation, not store it, showcasing the Cholas' advanced understanding of hydraulic engineering.</div>
